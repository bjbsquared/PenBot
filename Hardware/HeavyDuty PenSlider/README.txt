# Summary

Recently the pen holder on my drawing machine had broke. After thinking about it, I saw that it could use a redesign. I believe this pen holder will work much better for people making this machine. It uses an M3 or M4 screw to hold the pen in place. What makes this pen holder different from the original:
- Easier to print
- Stronger than original pen holder
- Combines two part into one (Less parts to print)
- Prevents the pen from bending if tightened too much

There are two versions of the pen holder to choose from:
- M3-With-Nut-Slot (Uses an M3 screw and nut)
- M4-With-Nut-Slot (Uses an M4 screw and nut)
- M3-Without-Nut-Slot (Uses an M3 screw, friction fit)
- M4-Without-Nut-Slot (Uses an M4 screw, friction fit)
